Domain Interaction Graph Guided ExploreR (DIGGER) helps to investigate the impact of alternative splicing on protein-protein interactions (PPI) on the level of an exon, event, transcript, or the whole network. DIGGER is ideally suited to investigate the difference in interactions
between the isoforms, analyze the effect of isoform switch, or to explore how alternative splicing events such as exon skipping lead to altered
interactions of protein isoforms.   

# The concept of DIGGER

Experimental evidence suggests that the majority of protein isoforms have different interaction partners. However, conducting experiments for all possible isoforms will be time- and resource-consuming. Domain Interaction Graph Guided ExploreR (DIGGER) integrates protein-protein and domain-domain interactions (DDI) into a joint graph and maps interacting residues to exons  (Figure 1, **A**). The concept is the following: if an alternative splicing event leads to splicing out an interacting domain or residues, the interaction between proteins might be lost or impaired.

  <em>Figure 1: The overview of DIGGER</em>
</p>

DIGGER uses the following sources for PPI, DDIs, and interacting residues:

- BioGRID (PPIs)
- 3did (DDIs)
- DOMINE (DDIs)
- PDB (interacting residues)

Domain-domain interaction predictions are based on the predictions of [PPIDM](10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008844).

DIGGER provides PPI visualizations in a structural context using a dynamic graph visualization that can be toggled between a protein
isoform and a domain-centric view (Figure 1, **B**). Furthermore, the tool maps the protein features encoded by a selected exon,
to judge the functional role of individual exons in the PPI (Figure 1, **C**).  DIGGER’s joint PPI and domain-domain interaction network can also be used for subnetwork extraction, providing a basis for network analysis (Figure 1, **D**).

Finally, DIGGER provides a web interface for **NEASE** (Network Enrichment method for Alternative Splicing Events) - a tool for the functional enrichment of alternative splicing exons/events.

# Step-by-step functional analysis of alternative splicing

## Isoform-level analysis

The isoform-level analysis investigates the difference in interactions between isoforms or the consequences of isoform switches. The documentation will use an example of BAG1 and NCK2 genes from the [DIGGER publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa768). 

As input (Figure 2), isoform-level analysis accepts the name of a gene, an Ensebml identifier of a gene, and an Ensembl identifier of a transcript. A user can also put multiple identifiers separated by a comma. Then a user should select an organism. Currently, DIGGER contains the data from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus.

<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 2: Input genes are BAG1 and NCK2; the chosen organism is Homo sapiens.</em>
</p>

If there is information about interactions for the isoforms of interest, the resulting window will show a summary of information about them in a network ('Network') and tabular views ('Queries'). A user can switch between them in the menu in the upper left corner.

A network view (Figure 3) provides information about known/predicted interactions of query isoforms. Predicted DDIs toggle bars allow the addition of predicted DDIs of different levels of confidence. Interactions lost or impaired due to splicing are marked as dashed lines. A user could also adjust the view of the network by enabling/disabling physics and adjusting the height of a canvas.

<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 3: A network view for chosen isoforms of BAG1 and NCK2.</em>
</p>

The tabular view (Figure 4) presents the information about query isoforms or all annotated protein-coding isoforms if a query consists of a gene name/identifier. The Pfam domains column contains information about known PFAM domains of a resulting protein. "Present / Missing interacting domains in the isoform" column demonstrates the percentage of interactions possibly lost or impaired for this particular isoform due to alternative splicing. To further investigate the impact of a splicing event, a user can click 'Visualize'.

</p>

A "Visualize" window, provides five different visualization panels: Overview, Protein View, Interaction View, Domain View, and Other Isoforms.

The Overview window header (Figure 5) shows the general information about the transcript.

</p>

This page also contains a scheme of transcript exons and mapped Pfam domains, and the table of all exons and Pfam domains mapped on exons (Figures 6, 7).

</p>

The Protein view shows all known direct interactors of an isoform. View mode can be changed from PPI to PPI-DDI view (Figure 8).

## Exon-level analysis

The Exon-level analysis investigates the consequences of exon skipping events to interactions between isoforms.

In addition to input (Figure 12) as in isoform-level analysis, exon-level analysis accepts an Ensebml identifier of an exon, an Ensembl identifier of a gene with the coordinates of an exon. A user can also put multiple identifiers separated by a comma. Then a user should select an organism.

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/OlgaVT/DIGGER/blob/patch-1/docs/Figure12.png/>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 12: An input exon is exon ENSE00003569638 from BAG1; the organism is Homo sapiens</em>
</p>

Results of the exon analysis consist of DomainView, ProteinView, InteractionView, and the table of Proteins that use this exon. DomainView, ProteinView, and InteractionView are similar to Isoform-level analysis but for an exon of interest. DomainView additionally shows the information about the corresponding Pfam domain with a link to the Pfam and 3did database (Figure 13).

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 13: A DomainView for and exon ENSE00003569638 </em>
</p>

A table "Proteins that use this exon" (Figure 14) reports the list of all protein-coding isoforms that encodes this exon:

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 14: A table "Proteins that use this exon" for an exon ENSE00003569638 </em>
</p>


## Network-level analysis
Network analysis investigates the systematic impact of alternative splicing events on the PPIs. As input (Figure 15), Network-level analysis accepts the list of genes, transcripts, proteins, or a transcript count file and constructs a subnetwork from this list.
<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/OlgaVT/DIGGER/blob/patch-1/docs/Figure15.png/>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 15: An example input for Network-level analysis </em>
</p>

If interactions between isoforms are known, the isoforms are connected to the subnetworks, and the interactions are marked as lost or present as well as based on the interaction evidence (Figure 16). For further exploration, the network can be downloaded in SIF or GraphML formats.

# Running NEASE

**NEASE** (Network Enrichment method for Alternative Splicing Events) is a splicing-based functional network enrichment tool. Currently, NEASE supports the following formats:
- Standard (List of genes with exon coordinates)
- MAJIQ *deltapsi.tsv
- Whippet *.diff
- rMATS SE.MATS.JC.txt

If you have a lot of files to run with NEASE, consider using the Python package: https://github.com/louadi/NEASE.

To start the analysis, upload your file (**A**), define an organism (**B**) (currently, Homo sapiens or Mus musculus), the input file type (**C**), and adjust the parameters.

For all input files except MAJIQ:
- Usage of predicted DDIs (**D**)
- Analysis name (**E**)
- P-value cutoff (**F**)
- Minimum delta PSI (Min delta, **G**)

For MAJIQ:
- Minimum delta PSI will start by default from 0.2 (Min delta, **G**)
- Confidence interval (0.95 corresponds to P-value 0.05, **H**)
<p align="center">
</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 17: NEASE starting page </em>
</p>

The results of the analysis will be stored for **7 days** and visible from the NEASE starting page (Previous Analyses). For large files, the running time might take up to several minutes.

The resulting 'Overview' page contains: 
- the general information about the number of genes with AS that affect any known protein feature;
- the table of affected protein domains;
- the table with affected interactions;
- the table with affected linear features;
- the table with affected interacting residues.

All tables are downloadable in a CSV format.

NEASE contains three further types of analysis: enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, and visualization.

NEASE edge enrichment supports the following ontologies:

Homo sapiens: 
- PharmGKB
- HumanCyc
- Wikipathways
- Reactome
- KEGG
  
Mus musculus
- KEGG
- Reactome
- MouseCyc

Type in the name of the ontology of interest and click the "Run enrichment" button. The resulting table will show the list of pathways, the list of genes that lost/impaired interactions with these pathways due to alternative splicing, and the significance assessment with p-value and adjusted p-value. NEASE score re-weights the pathways according to the hub bias. For more details, check the [NEASE publication] (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02538-1).

To investigate the enriched pathways in detail, use Pathway analysis. Type in the pathway ID from NEASE edge enrichment analysis, e.g., "path:mmu04010". The resulting table contains the information about each gene with list/impaired interactions with this pathway due to alternative splicing: whether it belongs to the pathway, how many interactions were lost/impaired, and the p-value.

Finally, "Visualize pathways" option provides the visualization of teh resulting network with lost/impaired interactions. Be aware, the visualization might take up to several minutes.

## Extending DIGGER by DDIs
If you downloaded the data provided by us, the extended DDIs are already included and you will **not** have to do 
this step. Only extend DIGGER like this if you want to add new organisms and have sufficient data to do so.  
To extend DIGGER using generated Domain-Domain Interactions (DDIs) follow these steps:
````bash
# First, create a conda environment to ensure you have all dependencies installed
conda env create -f DIGGER_env.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate DIGGER

# Make sure you have the necessary files in the sourcedata folder
# more info about what these files should look like can be found in the sourcedata README.md

# copy the example database_sources to have a backup and list of all options. 
# Edit the database_sources.yml file to your needs
cp preprocess/sourcedata/example.database_sources.yml preprocess/sourcedata/database_sources.yml

# Run the prediction script
cd preprocess
python main_ddi_extend.py

# Once this has run, depending on your settings, restarting the DIGGER container will show the new data
cd ..
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
````
